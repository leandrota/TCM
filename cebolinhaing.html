                    Cebolácio Júnior Menezes da Silva, better known as Cebolinha
                    With his five strands of hair and his green t-shirt, Cebolinha is Mônica's great rival in
                    dispute
                    for leader of Bairro do Limoeiro. Its main feature is to change the letter “R” to “L”, the
                    what
                    doesn't stop you from creating crazy plans. But he usually ends up running away from the rabbits in the house.
                    Monica.
                    He ignores all the defects he uses to mess with Mônica and uses his virtues both with his
                    family, as well as with your friends.

                    Initially, Cebolinha had a thick head of hair, even though he was a boy with spiky hair.
                    He was chubby and smaller in stature. Over time, the amount of hair
                    It decreased until it had just five strands, similar to those we see in the current Cebolinha. He too
                    had his "chubby cheeks" period, but, like the other characters, was
                    gradually adjusting until becoming the Cebolinha we know today.
